# Ngrok URL Notificator
This script can send url, which was generated by ngrok service running on your local machine to slack.


## Background
In our univeristy, we can not open ngrok's web page due to internal network policy.  
Because of this problem, we can't check ngrok's url, generated by running on our local machine.  
This script can check ngrok's url through slack app.  


## Requriment
You must install jq, which will be used by this script.

```
$ sudo apt install jq
```


Before running scripts, you should run ngrok service.  
If you want to access to local machine by using ssh, for example, you have to execute a following command.
```
$ ./ngrok tcp 22 -region=ap
```
In case of executed above command, you can send ngrok url to slack by running *send\_ngrok\_tcp\_url\_to\_slack.sh*   

If you want to publish web service, you have to execute a following command.
```
$ ./ngrok http 80 -region=ap
```
In case of executed above command, you can send ngrok url to slack by running *send\_ngrok\_http\_url\_to\_slack.sh*   

You have to prepare slack apps for using scripts.  
Before running, please make slack apps and get slack webhook urls.
